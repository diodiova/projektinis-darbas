Nimble was nimble and he was quick\nBut Jam Master cut faster, Jack's on Jay's dick\nNow Little Bo Peep cold lost her sheep\nAnd Rip Van Winkle fell the hell asleep\nAnd Alice chilling somewhere in Wonderland\nJack's serving Jill a bucket in his hand\nAnd Jam Master Jay's making all that sound\nThe turntables might wobble, but they don't fall down\nNow Dr. Seuss and Mother Goose both did their thing\nBut Jam Master's getting loose and D.M.C.'s the king\n'Cause he's adult entertainer, child educator\nJam Master Jay king of the crossfader\nHe's the better of the best, best believe he's the baddest\nPerfect timing when I'm climbing, I'm a rhyming apparatus\nLot of guts, when he cuts, girls move their butts\nHis name is Jay, hear the play, he must be nuts\nAnd on the mix real quick and I'd like to say\nHe's not Flash, but he's fast and his name is Jay\nIt, it goes a one, two, three, and\nJay's like King Midas as I was told\nEverything that he touch turn to gold\nHe's the greatest of the greater, get it straight, he's great\nPlaying fame 'cause his name is known in every state\nHis name is Jay, to see him play, will make you say\n\"God damn that DJ made my day\"\nLike the butcher, the baker, the candlestick maker\nHe's a maker, a breaker, and a title taker\nLike the little old lady who lived in a shoe\nIf cuts were kids he would be due\nNot lying y'all, he's the best I know\nAnd if I lie my nose will grow\nLike a little wooden boy named Pinocchio\nAnd you all know how the story go\nTricks are for kids, he plays much gigs\nHe's a big bad wolf and you're the three pigs\nHe's a big bad wolf in your neighborhood\nNot bad meaning bad, but bad meaning good\nThere it is\nWe're Run-D.M.C., got a beef to settle\nD's not Hansel, he's not Gretel\nJay's a winner, not a beginner\nHis pocket gets fat, others get thinner\nJ-j-j-j-j, jump on Jay like cow jumps moon\nPeople chase Jay like dish and spoon\nAnd like all fairy tales end\nYou'll see Jay again my friend, huh",

(Dear Mama)\nSweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)\nSweet lady, don't you know we love ya?\nNow, ain't nobody tell us it was fair\nNo love for my daddy, 'cause the coward wasn't there\nHe passed away and I didn't cry\n'Cause my anger wouldn't let me feel for a stranger\nThey say I'm wrong and I'm heartless, but all along\nI was lookin' for a father, he was gone\nI hung around with the thugs, and even though they sold drugs\nThey showed a young brother love\nI moved out and started really hangin'\nI needed money of my own, so I started slangin'\nI ain't guilty, 'cause even though I sell rocks\nIt feels good puttin' money in your mailbox\nI love payin' rent when the rent is due\nI hope you got the diamond necklace that I sent to you\n'Cause when I was low you was there for me\nYou never left me alone, because you cared for me\nAnd I could see you comin' home after work late\nYou're in the kitchen, tryin' to fix us a hot plate\nYou just workin' with the scraps you was given\nAnd Mama made miracles every Thanksgivin'\nBut now the road got rough, you're alone\nYou're tryin' to raise two bad kids on your own\nAnd there's no way I can pay you back\nBut my plan is to show you that I understand\nYou are appreciated\nLady, don't you know we love ya? (Dear Mama)\nSweet lady, place no one above ya (You are appreciated)\nSweet lady, don't you know we love ya?\nPour out some liquor and I reminisce\n'Cause through the drama, I can always depend on my mama\nAnd when it seems that I'm hopeless\nYou say the words that can get me back in focus\nWhen I was sick as a little kid\nTo keep me happy there's no limit to the things you did\nAnd all my childhood memories\nAre full of all the sweet things you did for me\nAnd even though I act crazy\nI gotta thank the Lord that you made me\nThere are no words that can express how I feel\nYou never kept a secret, always stayed real\nAnd I appreciate how you raised me\nAnd all the extra love that you gave me\nI wish I could take the pain away\nIf you can make it through the night, there's a brighter day\nEverything will be alright if you hold on\nIt's a struggle every day, gotta roll on\nAnd there's no way I can pay you back\nBut my plan is to show you that I understand\nYou are appreciated\nLady, don't you know we love ya?

Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it\nWe're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls\nWhen it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls\nLookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you\nDaddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news\nI try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems\nThe harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me\nAll the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see\nDaddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did\nWe did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me\nBut things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'\nTogether ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers\nBut then, of course, everything always happens for a reason\nI guess it was never meant to be\nBut it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is\nBut no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep\nMaybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream\nNow hush, little baby, don't you cry\nEverything's gonna be alright\nStiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the night\nI know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why\nWe feel how we feel inside\nIt may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\nBut I promise Mama's gon' be alright\nHeh, it's funny\nI remember back one year when Daddy had no money\nMommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree\nAnd said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em\nI'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying\n'Cause Daddy felt like a bum—see, Daddy had a job\nBut his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom\nAnd at the time, every house that we lived in\nEither kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block\nAnd your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar\nTryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college\nAlmost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it\nAnd I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart\nAnd it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart\nMom and Dad was arguin' a lot\nSo Mama moved back on to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment\nAnd Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara\nAnd that's when Daddy went to California with his CD\nAnd met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me\nBut Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me\nThen you started seein' Daddy on the TV\nAnd Mama didn't like it\nAnd you and Lainie were too young to understand it\nPapa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit\nAnd it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it\nI'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand\n'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud\nNow I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'\nLookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out\nTo see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now\nWow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here\nLainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here\nI like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?\nShh, Mama's only gone for the moment\nNow hush, little baby, don't you cry\nEverything's gonna be alright\nStiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the night\nI know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why\nWe feel how we feel inside\nIt may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\nBut I promise Mama's gon' be alright\nAnd if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird\nI'ma give you the world\nI'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you\nI'll do anything for you to see you smile\nAnd if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine\nI'ma break that birdie's neck\nI'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya\nAnd make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad (Haha)",

ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window — check yourself\nUh, Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance\nWith society, the driver seat, the first one to get killed\nSeen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out\nAt the same burger stand where **** hang out\nNow this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it\nBut ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different\nThat was back

news\nAin't no peace treaty, just piecin' BGs up to pre-approve\nBodies on top of bodies, IVs on top of IVs\nObviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys\nWhen you hop on that trolley, make sure your color's correct\nMake sure you're corporate, or they'll be callin' your mother collect\nThey say the governor collect all of our taxes, except\nWhen we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat\nYou movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC\nGo buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess\n​m.A.A.d. city\nMan down, where you from,

Fuck being normal!\nAnd I just bought a new raygun from the future\nJust to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad\n'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad\nSingin' to a man while he played piano\nMan, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel\nSo Ray J went straight to the radio station\nThe very next day, \"Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!\"\nLyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J.

I'm superhuman\nInnovative and I'm made of rubber so that anything you say is ricochetin' off of me and it'll glue to you and\nI'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating\nHow to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating\nNever fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting\nFor the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating\n'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated\nI make elevating music, you make elevator music\n\"Oh, he's too mainstream.\"\nWell, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it\n\"It's not hip-hop, it's pop,\"—'cause I found a hella way to fuse it\nWith rock, shock rap with Doc\nThrow on \"Lose Yourself\" and make 'em lose it\n\"I don't know how to make songs like that\nI don't know what words to use.\"\nLet me know when it occurs to you\nWhile I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you\nIt's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you\nHow many verses I gotta murder to\nProve that if you were half as nice, your songs you could sacrifice virgins too?!\nUgh, school flunky, pill junkie\nBut look at the accolades these skills brung me\nFull of myself, but still hungry\nI bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to\nAnd I'm a million leagues above you\nIll when I speak in tongues, but it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you\nI'm drunk, so, Satan, take the fucking wheel\nI'ma sleep in the front seat\nBumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still \"Chunky but Funky\"\nBut in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling\nAngels fight with devils and here's what they want from me\nThey're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate\nBut if you take into consideration the bitter hatred\nI have, then you may be a little patient\nAnd more sympathetic to the situation\nAnd understand the discrimination\nBut fuck it, life's handin' you lemons? Make lemonade then!\nBut if I can't batter the women\nHow the fuck am I supposed to bake 'em a cake then?\nDon't mistake him for Satan\nIt's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation\nTo trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and\nDon't be a retard—be a king?

Yeah, yeah\nLay your hand across my face, yeah, yeah\nTime we lost, that's all my fault\nPlease don’t be long, 'cause I want you now\nI don't have love without you around\nLife is too short, but I will live for you\nHow did this fit in your story? Yeah-eah\nWhy’d you let them judge your body? Yeah-eah\nI'll be waitin' there outside, yeah\nPlease don't be long, 'cause I want your all\nI don't have fun without your love\nLife is too short, but I will live for you\nYou're mucking off, but I will live for you, my selfless love\nBite my tongue, I wait my turn\nI waited for a century\nWaste my breath, no lessons learned\nI turn and face the enemy\nI'm not scared, just don’t care\nI’m not listening, you hear?\nHe's never there, but I don’t care\nI can't tell you what and where\nYeah-eah\nYeah-eah",
